# SO ZOHO

A Chrome extension which makes your ZOHO experience more pleasant.

Click [here](https://github.com/korstiaan/firefox-so-zoho) for the Firefox Add-on.

## Description

Currently it does the following:

* Increases the height of the textarea for a bug comment. Also makes it resizable.
* Prevents accidentally closing the buginfo overlay with ESC by asking for confirmation when
  the comment textarea has content.

## Download

The prebuild package can be downloaded from http://www.korstiaan.com/so-zoho/so-zoho.crx

on how to install these.
